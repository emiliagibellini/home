      content="My name is Emilia, and I love solving problems. Ever since I was a kid, I have been fascinated by math problems. Then, I became a Statistician and made a living out of it. My first working experiences were in research and consulting, after which I focused on improving my coding skills and started to develop machine learning projects. These days, I'm based in Buenos Aires and team up with other consultants, freelancers and AI companies to empower businesses through better use of data. If you're facing a new challenge and would like to discuss possible approaches, or if you already have a project on your mind, let's talk!"

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
